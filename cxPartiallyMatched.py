    """Executes a partially matched crossover (PMX) on the input individuals.
    The two individuals are modified in place. This crossover expects
    :term:`sequence` individuals of indices, the result for any other type of
    individuals is unpredictable.
    
    :param ind1: The first individual participating in the crossover.
    :param ind2: The second individual participating in the crossover.
    :returns: A tuple of two individuals.

    Moreover, this crossover generates two children by matching
    pairs of values in a certain range of the two parents and swapping the values
    of those indexes. For more details see [Goldberg1985]_.

    This function uses the :func:`~random.randint` function from the python base
    :mod:`random` module.
